## Personal

Currently I live in San Antonio Texas with my wife and our three rescue dogs. I am a Texas native but will always have a special place in my heart for Colorado which I visit frequently with my wife for the beautiful scenery and spectacular trails. Most of my free time is spent with my wife and our three dogs just enjoying life. Some of my hobbies are technology including computers, disc golf, board games, and staying active and healthy.
