## Personal

I currently live in San Antonio Texas with my wife, son, and our two dogs. I am a Texas native but will always have a special place in my heart for Colorado, which we visit frequently for the beautiful scenery and spectacular trails. Some of my hobbies are technology including computers, board games, and staying active and healthy.
