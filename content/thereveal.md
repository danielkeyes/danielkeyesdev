## View Your Reveal

To view your reveal, please download the app, ***[The Reveal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.danielkeyes.thereveal)***, from the Android App store and paste your code into the reveal block and hit the reveal button. 

If you have the app installed, you can also click the shared reveal link from your Android device to load the reveal directly into the app.  

## About The Reveal

I created this app as a way to do the birth reveal for my brother who is also an Android developer. I thought this would be a fun way to share details of his new nephew.

I also wanted to get some practice taking an App all the way from initial idea to the Android app store. 

This was written in my free time as just another way for me to continue my Android development practice. This is a free app and comes with no expressed warranty or guarantee. If you have any feedback, please reach out at ***daniel@danielkeyes.dev***. 

Thanks!
